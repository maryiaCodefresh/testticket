## Overview

You have a build that is triggered by multiple triggers, and you need to skip a certain step if the pipeline was launched using a cron trigger.

## Details

### Configure Cron Trigger Message

In your cron trigger configuration, set a message (e.g., "using cron") in the Message field.

### Implement Conditional Step

Utilize the EVENT_MESSAGE variable in your pipeline steps with a condition like:

{% raw %}
    ```yaml
    Freestyle:
      title: Running alpine image
      type: freestyle
      arguments:
        image: 'quay.io/codefreshplugins/alpine:3.8'
        commands:
          - echo "Displayed only when triggered by cron"
      when:
        condition:
          all:
            validateTriggerType: '"${{EVENT_MESSAGE}}" != "using cron"'
    ```
{% endraw %}

This ensures specific steps execute only when the cron job message is different from "using cron" and pipeline is triggered by cron.
